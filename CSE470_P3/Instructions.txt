Windows VS 2010- FreeGlut - Librarys included

I used the example files provided to help created this program

Camera
Is it own class.
I used spherical coordinates and then converted to cartesian coordinates

MeshObjects
I created a mesh object class that with sub classes for each basic shape. All objects can be stored in a single vector and rendered with same render function.

Mesh Loader
Used example loader to load data file. Then imported vertices and indices into my MeshObject class to format for my render function.
