Windows VS 2010- FreeGlut - Librarys included
Release EXE - \CSE470_P4\Release\CSE470_P4.exe

Based of Project 3
I used the example files provided to help created this program

Menu
Right click to bring up game menu

Controls

Camera Controls
Left and Right arrow to rotate camera
Up and Down arrow to move forward and backwards
S and A to move camera up and down
W and Q to rotate camera view up and down

Light Controls
Left and Right arrow to move light


MeshObjects
Added a new constructor to all sub MeshObjects for passing in a texture id thus enabling texture coordinates

Textures
Loaded with stb_image.
Function for loading all the textures: load_textures

Material
There is a "material_design" function that is used to change the material properties based on the texture of the object when enabled

Normals
MeshBox shading seems to work better with face normal - Probably need to have sub divide each face in to smaller rectangles in order to improve shading.

MeshSphere
Used http://learningwebgl.com/blog/?p=1253 for understanding how to generate a uv sphere and code

MeshCone
Modified algorithm from Sphere to create a better Cone algorithm for texturing.
